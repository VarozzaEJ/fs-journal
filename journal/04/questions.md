# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

1.  What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

> Asynchronous code is when things can run on their own without needing other things to run before. Synchronous code requires functions or methods to run beforehand.

2.  What is an event listener?

> Event listeners listen for something to happen inside of a function and when it does, will trigger another function or event.

3.  What does _REST_ stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

> Representational State Transfer... This is placing multiple parameters into a function that can allow for varying functions. The parameters placed into the function also get put into a seperate array.

4.  What is a callback / higher order function?

> A callback function is a function that gets passed into a different function as a parameter. A higher order function is a function that has an argument being passed through it as a parameter.

5.  What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

> A promise is an object that will produce a single value sometime in the future. You can capture and use an error from a promise with the catch() function.

6.  Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

> GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE

7.  What does the `API` acronym stand for?

> Application Programming Interface

8.  What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

> You have to call the await keyword inside of an Asynchronous function.

9.  What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

> The purpose of encapsulation is hiding things inside of classes to where unauthroized people cannot access that part of your code.

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

> The response is 200OK

11. What is a 400 error?

> This occurs when a client or browser sends a request to the server but it unsuccessfully does so, leading to the error and failed loading.
