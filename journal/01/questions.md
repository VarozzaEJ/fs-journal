# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > Git allows teams to work together on the same projects. It also allows you as the individual to save your progress and have a jumping point to start from when things go wrong.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > This stands for Make Directory and will make a new folder inside the folder you were already in.

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > Pseudo classes are styles that are only added when something happens to the thing being selected. For example, :hover only happens when the mouse hovers over the thing being selected.

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Specificity is the amount of importance that each class in CSS has. A class with a specificity of 0 1 0 is going to take priority over one with 0 0 1. Specificity also goes as 100/10/1

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > With more than one things using !important, you end up having a max priority error where two things are fighting for power. 

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > the first is the h1 selector that selects all of the h1 tags. The second is the color: selector that changes the color of the words. The third is the rgb value and that is how you can change the color of everything inside the h1 tag.

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > Good design helps people to spend more time on your website. It can help a client to reach more people or even make more money.

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > Wireframes are a good way for developers to understand the functionality of there website. It is easier to make significant changes to things when they are simple.

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > I think that as I get faster at getting the basic structure of websites completed, they will be extremely worth the time. It would be hard to make something look pretty and then ruin it because something wasn't in the place they wanted.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > flex is an unabsolute way to change the way things appear on a page. This is required because people have different sized screens and absolute changes to the way things look might not look good on different sized screens.

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
