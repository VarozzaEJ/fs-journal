# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    My team and I started out with quite differing ideas. After collaborating for almost two days, we were able to come together and figure out what we each wanted and put it all together.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
    I realized that working in a group is a lot more fun than I was anticipating. It is very interesting to see how other people's brains work and how they think.
- What are you struggling with?
    I wouldn't say that I am struggling with anything this week. At least nothing that comes to the top of my head.
- What would you count as a victory?
    I would count getting our pitch done and actually starting our project a win. I am very excited to start and work together as a team.
